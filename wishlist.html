        <h3>
            <span style="color: #ff5cb8">2時までのシンデレラ~Friday Magic~</span>, more commonly known simply as <span style="color: #ff5cb8">Friday Magic</span>, is
            an album made by Japanese city pop artist Meiko Nakahara. The album
            contains 10 tracks and was originally released on a double-sided cassette
            tape. The most popular song on this album is titled "Fantasy," and is the
            first track on side A. Currently, the entire album is not avalible on
            Spotify due to unknown reasons. She released this album in 1982, however
            she disappeared around 30 years ago. It's unknown where she is, but it is
            known that she has helped compose many songs up to 2019. The main reason I
            want this album is just to experience the rest of the songs it holds!
            Fantasy is such a great song, and Meiko is a wonderful singer!

          <span style="color: #f22727">Heathers</span>, 2014, is just a really good musical! I really enjoy it and its cast. My favorite song is <span style="color: #f22727">Candy Store</span>

          <span style="color: #ff2097">Copic</span> markers are SUPER expensive but worth it! So I've heard at least, I haven't been able to experience them at all. But maybe one day I can afford em! They're like $5.75 a marker.

        <h3>
            I actually don't know a lot about this book, but I own a manga adaptation
            and from what I have read thus far it's very nice. It's suspected that the
            book was the author's suicide note before he and his lover jumped into a
            river.

            SCP-978, The Desire Camera. This camera shows the desires of the person
            being photographed. Why do I want this fictional object? It's just cool!
            Imagine the possibliites and the scarring! I'd really need amnestics after
            someone has a really bad one.
